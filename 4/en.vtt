00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
Welcome back everyone. Today Pat and I will be reviewing an online session you played with pretty high stakes.

2
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.200
What do you have for us here, brother?

3
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:15.800
Table 1 is $150 on GG. Table 2 is a $2k/$4k big game. Table 3 is a $215 MTT. Then a $1k Thrill, a $630, and a $54.

4
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.500
Cool. Let's jump in. Immediately we see you playing a big pot with AQ. Remember the action?

5
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.199
Pre-flop we open 2BB, he 3-bets to 10BB.

6
00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:27.500
What do you think pre-flop? What does your red dot mean?

7
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:34.000
It marks a 'red line' player. I think the decision is easy versus a red line guy. Clear call. I'd fold versus nits.

8
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.500
For those watching, 2BB to 10BB against general population is an easy fold. But against a good aggressive reg?

9
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:47.000
A red line player has a high win rate without showdown. They are aggressive and have appropriate bluffs.

10
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Good point. So they make it 10BB, you call. Pot size indicates they c-bet a quarter and you called?

11
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Yeah, c-bet a quarter. Decision on the turn now. What do you think about turn with AQ?

12
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.000
One of the worst hands we land with. Opponent plays Kx this way, but also plays hands that beat us that might fold now or later.

13
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.500
I'm torn on whether to bluff. Lean towards bluffing?

14
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.500
If you're torn, it's close. If you lean bluff every time, you aren't losing much EV.

15
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:21.000
Here, it's important not to block hands like QQ♥️ calling turn and folding river, rather than blocking flushes.

16
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
AQ without a ♥️ becomes a good triple barrel.

17
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.500
Tough. I have QJs. Don't have AJo pre. Most bluffs will be AQ, 65s, 54s. Struggling for bluffs.

18
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:40.000
We have 15 combos of AQ bluffs. We have TT for value. Probably play AA this way too. Just thinking if we are over-bluffing.

19
00:05:00.312 --> 00:05:04.098
Yeah, that's a big point. Sometimes it's the best option to overbluff.

20
00:05:04.098 --> 00:05:10.500
I 100% agree. If you're in this spot, always shove AA here versus almost anyone when they make it 10bb.

21
00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:15.199
The solver might slow play, but don't do it. Just always shove AA, always shove KK.

22
00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:20.800
When the option's close, and bluffing small is really good, just always take that bluffing small option.

23
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:27.100
We don't need to bet big to get AT♠️ or JJ without a ♥️ to fold.

24
00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.899
Yeah, and I think there is a ton of EV in betting turn.

25
00:05:30.899 --> 00:05:36.199
I think the turn is mandatory because of the Tx and the JJ with no heart.

26
00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:39.500
But then the question is: do we follow through or not?

27
00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.600
Looks like you're going third and not quarter? You rewound the hand.

28
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:48.199
Yeah, I wanted to get the earliest street. I went 8.5bb.

29
00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:52.399
So 8.5bb is going to be a mandatory call versus most players.

30
00:05:52.399 --> 00:05:58.798
Checking who he is might not change my pre-flop decision with AQ, but it sets my mindset for the hand.

31
00:05:58.798 --> 00:06:04.500
He went third instead of quarter, which makes sense based on the smaller pre-flop raise.

32
00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:10.199
But I don't think it changes our decision tree. We still call flop and bet turn.

33
00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:14.598
It's just information for later. It doesn't change the decision immediately.

34
00:06:14.598 --> 00:06:21.500
I wouldn't like betting turn then giving up river. Either bet turn and follow through, or check turn.

35
00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.000
Oh, you don't like shutting down?

36
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.098
I never shut down. Once he checks twice, you get good bluffing opportunities.

37
00:06:28.098 --> 00:06:31.899
The more a range checks, the more likely it is to fold.

38
00:06:31.899 --> 00:06:36.500
When he bets flop and checks twice, 99 is always in that range.

39
00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:40.798
When we bet turn, that range still has AA and AK.

40
00:06:40.798 --> 00:06:44.399
You strip the strong hands when he double checks.

41
00:06:44.399 --> 00:06:49.500
It's important to point out that 99 are not in this range for a lot of players.

42
00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:53.000
Neither is ATs, neither is AJ.

43
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.199
A strong argument can be made for folding against players who are massively under 3-bet.

44
00:06:58.199 --> 00:07:03.199
And the speed of the 3-bet. When playing 6 tables, I really watch timing.

45
00:07:03.199 --> 00:07:08.500
If he has A5s, he thinks 'do I flat or 3-bet?'. If he has AK, he just 3-bets.

46
00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:12.800
We ran into AK, which doesn't say much about my bluff really.

47
00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:16.199
It only says a lot if he calls with AT♠️.

48
00:07:16.199 --> 00:07:21.500
So you limp AA, 100bb deep on table 1. Let's talk about limping theory.

49
00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:26.500
From a GTO perspective, it wants more limps at 100bb deep stack depth.

50
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.480
...the positional disadvantage, that's again from a theoretical perspective,

51
00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:07.759
against weaker opponents who are going to overfold post-flop.

52
00:10:07.759 --> 00:10:11.759
I'm a big, big fan of having a very high SB raise, just 'cause I think they play so bad.

53
00:10:11.759 --> 00:10:16.799
I think people overfold to it, they overfold flop, therefore you're profiting a lot.

54
00:10:16.799 --> 00:10:20.558
You also don't get limp 3-bet bluffed by an average guy.

55
00:10:20.558 --> 00:10:23.919
They don't limp 76s and then 3-bet.

56
00:10:23.919 --> 00:10:25.838
I'll take that raising, I'm doing the SB.

57
00:10:25.838 --> 00:10:27.600
Oh from the SB? Yeah, yeah, sure.

58
00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.960
Well, it works both ways, like people are too passive in position and out of position.

59
00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:35.038
Just do something aggressive blind versus blind and it's going to work well.

60
00:10:35.038 --> 00:10:39.119
And this is actually the spot you're talking about when you're in the BB and SB limps...

61
00:10:39.119 --> 00:10:46.479
...is actually something Chrissy recently talked about where like in early stages at really deep stacks, if the SB limps,

62
00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:52.479
she just raises and doesn't really care if she gets called because of the fold frequency post-flop is high enough...

63
00:10:52.479 --> 00:10:55.759
...that like she's just winning a bigger pot on average.

64
00:10:55.759 --> 00:11:00.320
And so attacking like the capped range, those weaker ranges that limp-call...

65
00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:05.120
...when people are unbalanced is just going to turn a really nice profit.

66
00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:09.120
So back to the decision at hand, what sizing do you like here and why?

67
00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:13.438
Well I think when I'm playing a $150 tournament, there's two things that I ask myself straight away:

68
00:11:13.438 --> 00:11:16.798
Who is the opponent and what does my hand want to do?

69
00:11:16.798 --> 00:11:21.038
Who is the opponent? What does my hand want to do? AA wants to get lots of money in pre-flop.

70
00:11:21.038 --> 00:11:23.759
So what's the best way to do that?

71
00:11:23.759 --> 00:11:28.158
Um, in general, if I'm limping AA, it's versus someone that is going to do the Chrissy B thing, right?

72
00:11:28.158 --> 00:11:32.479
That's going to raise 85o 100% frequency.

73
00:11:32.479 --> 00:11:36.639
That way, like they're going to put 3.5 bigs in and then we want to check-raise to really big sizing.

74
00:11:36.639 --> 00:11:42.798
Cause we want to now get... 85o is going to fold whatever, but we want to get the maximum versus JTs or whatever.

75
00:11:42.798 --> 00:11:47.438
Versus a range that wants to see a flop, you want to charge that range a lot of money cause it's not going to 4-bet.

76
00:11:47.438 --> 00:11:51.279
He's never going to 4-bet a bluff here, he's just going to see a flop.

77
00:11:51.279 --> 00:11:54.158
So in those instances it's very good to go big with value.

78
00:11:54.158 --> 00:11:57.680
When your range is kind of polarized, the other person is incentivized to call.

79
00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:02.078
That's... when your polarity increases, your sizing generally wants to increase with it...

80
00:12:02.078 --> 00:12:05.438
...cause you're not interested in seeing a flop, if that makes sense. So really nice big check-raise sizing.

81
00:12:05.438 --> 00:12:09.120
The absolute smallest I think we should go here is like 13 to 14.

82
00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:11.438
I could definitely see logic for going larger.

83
00:12:11.438 --> 00:12:14.639
I think I went 15... I gave the AA discount.

84
00:12:14.639 --> 00:12:16.719
You gotta just give him a little bit of rope keeping in.

85
00:12:16.719 --> 00:12:20.799
That's why I thought about 13 or 14 cause you have that AA discount because like, yeah, you're looking for action.

86
00:12:20.799 --> 00:12:24.479
13.9 or something, 13.99 for a little discount.

87
00:12:24.479 --> 00:12:25.759
Yeah, I'm in for it.

88
00:12:25.759 --> 00:12:29.438
Let's see what I do. I go... okay, I go pretty big. I go big and chunky.

89
00:12:29.438 --> 00:12:34.240
But yeah, just always asking myself, who is the villain and what does my hand want to do?

90
00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:38.240
So if it's a passive guy, I would just raise 7x there because he's not going to 3-bet me...

91
00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:41.840
...and he's going to call JTs whatever I do. So just target the inelastic continues kind of.

92
00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:47.360
If you go 3.5x with AA, that's kind of the only money that's going in there unless he has JJ, TT, QQ.

93
00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:51.680
They 3-bet if you go 7 anyway, so you're just guaranteeing money gets in there.

94
00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:53.598
Yeah, definitely.

95
00:12:53.598 --> 00:12:57.598
Um, now let's talk about table three. We're UTG, jams 8-handed for 7bb.

96
00:12:57.598 --> 00:13:00.719
We have ATs. What are your like thought process here?

97
00:13:00.719 --> 00:13:03.438
Um, who is villain and what does my hand want to do?

98
00:13:03.438 --> 00:13:05.120
I think I just want to fold here.

99
00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:08.799
Um, this range shouldn't have many hands that we dominate in it.

100
00:13:08.799 --> 00:13:13.199
As in A9o can raise-fold, that's the only one. And there's 5 stacks behind.

101
00:13:13.199 --> 00:13:18.399
Yeah, but like, A9o could raise-fold, but will it raise-fold or will it just shove?

102
00:13:18.399 --> 00:13:22.078
AJ, AK, AQ always shove... they dominate.

103
00:13:22.078 --> 00:13:26.559
Yeah. I would say that like there is a certain percentage of the population who just jams way too many of their weak Ax combos here...

104
00:13:26.559 --> 00:13:30.799
...and is just jamming too wide for 7. And so, you know, who is my opponent is naturally a very good first question.

105
00:13:30.799 --> 00:13:33.279
But I think this one's extremely close.

106
00:13:33.279 --> 00:13:38.240
One thing, if it's close, like let's say I have 30bb here and I can call-fold to everyone behind.

107
00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:58.240
Or it's not that big of a... One third of my stack's quite a big hit to take, right?

108
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
I don't know.

109
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:08.500
So 9 off the money, I think better to just... if I'm not sure, just put zero in.

110
00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:15.000
Oh, 9 off the money? See, that's an incredibly important factor.

111
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:23.000
You're 18 off the money. 79 left, 61 pay. It makes it significantly closer when there's this much ICM.

112
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:29.000
Players are going to shove tighter, chips in our stack are much more valuable than they are otherwise.

113
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.500
So what if you're in the first 40% of a tournament?

114
00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:37.000
Oh, we gambling. We getting our gambling shoes on.

115
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Your range is strong enough here where you probably don't want to have that many call folds. You're not looking to VPIP tons of hands here.

116
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:52.000
So you have enough traps in your calling range that you're comfortable calling. Maybe if we flat here, AQ hero folds?

117
00:15:52.000 --> 00:16:00.000
Yeah, I think call is better as well. But it is worth noting that if someone jams the CO and you have ATs on the BTN, it's going to be a re-jam.

118
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:06.000
For sure. But then you don't have five guys behind that can wake up with TT or JJ.

119
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:12.000
Just a close spot, I'll keep my 20 BBs and operate. I'd prefer to do that.

120
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:18.000
So, assuming you fold. Are you gonna fold? You can just tell us and we can go to the other hand here.

121
00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
I thought I'd keep the suspense. No, I just fold, yeah.

122
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000
So I'm going to go back to this Q5♥️ hand.

123
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:30.000
MP opens, SB calls, we overcall Q5s.

124
00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:38.000
It comes nothing for us. The turn is an A♥️ after it checks through. And what are your thoughts on leading versus checking?

125
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:43.000
I think a lot of people will just think like 'Oh I have a flush draw I have to lead'.

126
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:53.000
I don't see much fold equity here. The way Q5 makes its EV is once in position checks back and says I don't have QJ or KJ, I have 66.

127
00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000
At the moment I'm attacking two ranges that still have Jx.

128
00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:05.000
If I check the turn, I can hit my flush or I can bluff with more info. Delaying this hand till the river makes a lot of sense.

129
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:12.000
Yeah, and I do think it's a spot where people make the mistake of just leading turn because they have equity. I don't think you're gonna get folds often enough.

130
00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:20.000
It comes back to that thing: what does my hand want to do? Q5 wants to see a river for really good bluffing spots and it wants to realize.

131
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000
Have I called the river here? You did call the river here.

132
00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:30.000
I didn't see him value betting 88... And I thought a Jack would bet the turn really often.

133
00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:38.000
So sometimes we lose to J9s, J8s, JTs. But there's K-highs, 98s. There's enough bluffs in there I think.

134
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:43.000
I was actually really just surprised to see his exact hand. He showed you a full house bro.

135
00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000
If he value bet 99, well played. I just wouldn't expect it.

136
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:52.000
But we saved the whole stack mate, we saved 4 BBs back.

137
00:17:52.000 --> 00:18:00.000
Do you think people have the mental aspect of 'well my hand could have bet the turn so it's okay if I lose a bet anyway'?

138
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:08.000
No, I think people have the mental aspect of they need to win the pot rather than make the maximum EV decision.

139
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:15.000
You checking the turn there will make more money for Q5♥️ but you'll lose the pot more often. It's a very strange paradox.

140
00:20:00.299 --> 00:20:02.099
I can just call the river.

141
00:20:02.099 --> 00:20:05.500
There is definitely some logic to it. I kind of thought that way before.

142
00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:10.199
I could see people making that mistake where, let's say 66 checks back...

143
00:20:10.199 --> 00:20:15.799
...and someone leads the river. They think 'I would've lost if I c-bet anyway, so I can call 66.'

144
00:20:15.799 --> 00:20:20.898
But with 66, you're not putting the right amount of money in the pot, so it can't be that bad.

145
00:20:20.898 --> 00:20:25.099
If you were meant to lose this bet, it can't be too bad, I think.

146
00:20:25.099 --> 00:20:29.500
But that's the mental issue. We mentally trick ourselves into making mistakes.

147
00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:32.798
So you defend J6o here versus UTG+1?

148
00:20:32.798 --> 00:20:36.200
Yeah. I think the vast majority of people are just gonna fold this pre-flop.

149
00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:40.500
All charts are 2.2x or 2.3x at 36BB. None of them are min-raise.

150
00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:44.898
Also, something happens with the 6 because most of his range is Ace high.

151
00:20:44.898 --> 00:20:50.099
With the 6, hands like K6s flat 4-bets because of the 2-3-4-5 effect.

152
00:20:50.099 --> 00:20:54.398
I'd fold J5o and call J6o. But it's very marginal.

153
00:20:54.398 --> 00:20:59.200
Fair enough. Playing 6 tables, I take any small edge. At 10 tables, I fold this.

154
00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:03.500
That's an easy spot to miss with K8o. That's a pure call for 4BB.

155
00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:06.798
I don't know about that. What's the stack depth there?

156
00:21:06.798 --> 00:21:09.500
Why is this a pure call? I would always fold this.

157
00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:14.200
Run it in HRC. I used to fold too, but with money in the SB getting 3 to 1...

158
00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:17.500
Sometimes the original raiser shoves and it gets heads up.

159
00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:21.500
Also with 4BB, I'm looking for any reason to gamble.

160
00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:26.500
I can't reach the prize pool, I don't cover anyone. In PSKOs, you want to gamble when short.

161
00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:30.798
Keep in mind, your decision would change if registration wasn't still open.

162
00:21:30.798 --> 00:21:35.500
Not gonna lie, in a $55 game I'm more incentivized to gamble than in a 10k.

163
00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:39.900
The truth comes out. It's still a call. You should call way wider than people do.

164
00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:44.200
At 4-5 BBs when covered, find any excuse to gamble or you make no money.

165
00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:49.500
Table 4, you raised K10. BB is Joao, very good reg. What's your read?

166
00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:52.500
Yeah, solid player. Very good.

167
00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:56.798
I don't see him defending wide this deep. Are you balancing a wide c-bet range?

168
00:21:56.798 --> 00:22:00.500
Mostly small bets happen here. It's a flush draw board.

169
00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:05.098
He has good run outs around the 4 and 6, and a nut advantage.

170
00:22:05.098 --> 00:22:09.500
He has K6o, K4o, 64o, and we don't. So not much big betting.

171
00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:14.199
Technically. But if he check-raises a quarter pot often, I'll bet half pot.

172
00:22:14.199 --> 00:22:18.799
Who is the opponent? K10 wants action but has kicker problems.

173
00:22:18.799 --> 00:22:22.500
Folding AK? Video frozen... Oh, you added two more tables.

174
00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:05.098
Yeah, it should go back to normal in a second. Okay, I can adjust the thing though. Hold on a sec.

175
00:25:05.098 --> 00:25:10.500
So we didn't see the size that he check-raised on the flop with, but I imagine it's like 4x or 5x?

176
00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:20.000
It's pretty easy to figure out. You bet 1.4 into 5.6 and now there's 15.6, so he made it 5 big blinds.

177
00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:33.500
So again, this really comes down to player type. When you bet 25% on the flop, most high stakes regs are going to do a lot of check-raising with 6x and 4x.

178
00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:44.798
In a solver, those hands are always randomizing. It's very easy for a human to not randomize 65 and just check-raise versus 25%. So it's definitely an over-bluffed node.

179
00:25:44.798 --> 00:25:48.500
And then, what do you think about the turn? Would you bet or check?

180
00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:55.500
I think he is actually going to have a lot of flush draws as well facing the smaller sizing. He's also going to have 58, 78.

181
00:25:55.500 --> 00:26:03.000
But those gut-shots only have 6.6%, so it's not a big concern. I think if you go too much smaller, you might just get check-raised again.

182
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:13.500
I wouldn't mind... I think it's so unnatural for him to check value on the turn here. This is where you can actually make quite a lot of money waving the red flag.

183
00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:23.000
It's really tough for him to check-raise a flop with a 6 and then go for a double check-raise on the turn. You don't mind inducing here.

184
00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:32.000
You make a lot of money because it's easy for him to over-bluff. He's kind of repping exactly 44. If you trigger something, he's likely to just have a random 4x♣️ or 75.

185
00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:41.000
So he folds. Also going to go back to the AK at 42 effective. Let me get off this 4 wide screen.

186
00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:52.000
You'll notice the vast majority of people are just all-in for 40bb here with AK. And for most people, that's probably the best play.

187
00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:57.000
However, when you do have such an aggressive 4-betting and bluffing image, you get to click hands like this.

188
00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:10.000
This is 'Egyptian' the streamer. I've been coaching him for years. So he knows all about... he knows I might be light.

189
00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:16.000
There's definitely a non-zero percent chance he just takes A4s and he's just over it versus me here.

190
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:22.000
Also what it does do, the times it goes all-in, all-in, you can probably get away then.

191
00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:30.000
As in if the UTG guy shoves, and now Pat shoves with a cold 4-bet range behind, this is AA and KK only. So you can get away.

192
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:37.000
Yeah, I hadn't thought about that. Shove call, lose less, induce. Multi-faceted benefits here.

193
00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:48.000
If he has AJo or A5s, I'm fine with those hands calling. If he starts having 78s, now it becomes dicey, now I'm more likely to shove.

194
00:27:48.000 --> 00:28:02.000
As the range gets more linear, you shove AK. And then as the range gets more polar you're facing, then you start clicking it. If he's calling AQ, I'm always shoving AK.

195
00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:07.000
Yeah, for sure. All right, well let's end this part here, and we will see everyone in the next one.
