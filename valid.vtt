00:00:00.867 --> 00:00:07.727
Welcome back everyone. Today Pat and I will be reviewing an online session we played with pretty high stakes.

2
00:00:08.117 --> 00:00:08.977
What you got for us here, brother?

3
00:00:10.157 --> 00:00:12.496
Mate, it's all going off. It's all going off, mate.

4
00:00:13.367 --> 00:00:18.425
We've got the 215, 15 off the money top, right?

5
00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:23.277
No, hold on. Let's do table 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

6
00:00:23.637 --> 00:00:24.495
Yeah, it might. Okay.

7
00:00:24.876 --> 00:00:28.946
Table 1 is a 150 on GG PSKO.

8
00:00:30.146 --> 00:00:34.615
Table 2 is a 215 big game, which is another PSKO on GG.

9
00:00:35.326 --> 00:00:41.286
Table 3 is a 215, I think like 70k with 15 off the money.

10
00:00:41.837 --> 00:00:44.207
Table 4 is the 1K thrill on GG.

11
00:00:45.716 --> 00:00:50.817
630 table 5, and then table 6 is a $54.

12
00:00:52.267 --> 00:00:52.615
Cool.

13
00:00:53.646 --> 00:01:00.606
Well, let's jump right in and see what's going on. Immediately we see you playing a pretty big pot with AQ. Do you remember the action?

14
00:01:01.447 --> 00:01:06.337
Yes, so preflop, we open 2 BBs, he 3-bets to 10.

15
00:01:07.727 --> 00:01:08.795
What do you think preflop?

16
00:01:12.067 --> 00:01:13.257
What's your red dot mean?

17
00:01:14.495 --> 00:01:15.545
Means redline player.

18
00:01:17.396 --> 00:01:21.947
Okay. I think the decision is easy versus a redline guy. I think it's a really clear call.

19
00:01:22.376 --> 00:01:23.956
Yeah, absolutely. And then I'd fold.

20
00:01:24.716 --> 00:01:36.436
For those who notice, the very first question I ask is 'who's the player,' right? Because 2 to 10, a reasonable amount of general population or even at lower stakes is a very clear call or a very clear fold.

21
00:01:36.795 --> 00:01:40.795
And then again, against a good aggressive reg or as you call them a redline player, right?

22
00:01:41.597 --> 00:01:41.807
Yeah.

23
00:01:42.347 --> 00:01:47.477
Redline is if you look in PokerTracker, your win rate over time without showdown.

24
00:01:48.355 --> 00:01:52.887
So a redline player is typically going to be on the aggressive side, he's going to have all the appropriate bluffs here.

25
00:01:55.227 --> 00:01:55.855
Therefore.

26
00:01:55.855 --> 00:02:07.486
It's still, by the way, even if it's still winning very, very little versus the most aggro guy in the world, right? It's still a very, very, if you can fold, it's still a really marginal spot.

27
00:02:08.067 --> 00:02:09.115
Yeah, that's good to point that out.

28
00:02:09.806 --> 00:02:14.336
So they make it 10 you call and I assume based on the rest of the pot size they see that quarter and you call.

29
00:02:15.227 --> 00:02:18.735
Yeah, yeah, I see that quarter. And then we have a decision on the turn now.

30
00:02:20.105 --> 00:02:22.977
I don't remember the exact timing he took to check.

31
00:02:24.497 --> 00:02:28.167
But this hand, I think, what do you think about the turn here with AQ?

32
00:02:29.985 --> 00:02:32.847
It's one of the worst hands we land here with.

33
00:02:34.026 --> 00:02:45.925
I do think that our opponent does play some Kx this way, but also plays a lot of hands this way to beat us that might end up folding either now or later.

34
00:02:46.706 --> 00:02:46.917
Yeah.

35
00:02:48.515 --> 00:02:51.365
So I'm really torn on to bluff or not to bluff.

36
00:02:53.307 --> 00:02:55.276
I do think I lean bluff.

37
00:02:56.325 --> 00:02:56.977
Yeah, yeah.

38
00:02:58.336 --> 00:03:04.295
If you're really torn about whether to bluff or not, it's close whatever you do.

39
00:03:05.347 --> 00:03:08.575
If you just lean bluff every time, you're not going to be losing too much EV.

40
00:03:11.235 --> 00:03:28.757
I think in this particular spot, it's much better, it's more important here not to block a hand like QQ♥️ that's calling the turn folding the river, than it is to block flushes. There's not going to be many flushes in his 3-betting range from these positions.

41
00:03:29.615 --> 00:03:34.026
So I think AQ without a heart becomes a really good triple barrel.

42
00:03:36.466 --> 00:03:41.485
And then AQs♥️, pocket pairs with the heart are willing to check call, check call.

43
00:03:42.507 --> 00:03:48.716
It's kind of a tough, I'm going to have QJs, I'm not going to have AJo preflop.

44
00:03:51.526 --> 00:03:59.206
Most of my bluffs will probably be something like AQ and then 65s or 54s.

45
00:03:59.887 --> 00:04:05.468
And one of those combos are flush too, so I'm kind of struggling for bluffs here.

46
00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:13.146
Yeah, from a value perspective, are you going to be value betting KQ here to try to bet and shove, or are you going to bet and show?

47
00:04:14.497 --> 00:04:16.487
Mm, that's a very, very good question.

48
00:04:17.656 --> 00:04:25.797
My concern is that we're going to be over-bluffing this situation based on just a pure weighting of how much value and how many bluffs we might have.

49
00:04:26.557 --> 00:04:36.706
You know, because we have 15 combos of AQ that are bluffs, three of AJ that are bluffs, three of the four since AJ♥️ isn't there and then AQ♥️ isn't there too.

50
00:04:38.257 --> 00:04:43.687
Obviously we can have TT for three more combos of value, probably don't land here with 55s.

51
00:04:44.507 --> 00:04:49.497
You know, so we probably play AA this way as well for value, right? So there's a few more combos.

52
00:04:50.367 --> 00:04:58.117
So I'm just trying to think about one, if we bet this and bluff this, if we're going to be massively over-bluffing, and two, do we care?

53
00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:02.822
Yeah, yeah, that's a big point.

54
00:05:03.581 --> 00:05:08.831
Mhm. Because sometimes it's acceptable and the best option to overbluff.

55
00:05:09.841 --> 00:05:10.422
Yeah.

56
00:05:12.752 --> 00:05:21.841
I 100% agree. I think if you're in this spot, you always shove AA here versus almost anyone in the world when they make it 10 BB.

57
00:05:22.581 --> 00:05:27.271
A solver might slow play, don't do it, just always shove AA, always shove AA.

58
00:05:28.512 --> 00:05:28.930
Um.

59
00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:38.271
But yeah, on the river, I think when it's close and the good thing about bluffing the turn is we can bluff for a very small sizing.

60
00:05:39.521 --> 00:05:46.850
So we don't need to bet very big to get a hand like ATo♠️ to fold or JJ without hearts to fold.

61
00:05:47.451 --> 00:05:54.170
Mhm. So when the option's close and the option of bluffing small is really good, just always take that bluffing small option, I think.

62
00:05:54.581 --> 00:06:14.581
Yeah, and I do think that there is a ton of EV in betting turn.

63
00:10:00.677 --> 00:10:08.976
the position of disadvantage. That's again from a theoretical perspective against weaker opponents who are going to overfold post-flop.

64
00:10:09.307 --> 00:10:14.618
I'm a big, big fan of having a very high SB raise because I think they play so bad.

65
00:10:14.868 --> 00:10:19.047
I think people overfold to it. They overfold flop. Therefore, you're profiting a lot.

66
00:10:20.658 --> 00:10:24.087
You also don't get limp 3-bet bluffed by an average guy.

67
00:10:25.107 --> 00:10:27.427
They don't limp 79s. They don't limp 79o.

68
00:10:28.486 --> 00:10:30.346
Oh, for the SB. Yeah, yeah. Oh yeah, it's true, it's true.

69
00:10:31.256 --> 00:10:38.258
It works both ways. People are too passive in position and out of position. Just do something aggressive BB vs BB, and it's going to work well.

70
00:10:38.648 --> 00:10:57.977
And this is actually the spot you're talking about when you're in the BB and SB limps. This is actually something Chrissy recently talked about, where in early stages of really deep stacks, if the SB limps, she just raises and doesn't really care if she gets called because the fold frequency post-flop is high enough that she's just winning a bigger pot on average.

71
00:10:58.557 --> 00:11:10.596
So attacking the capped range, those weaker ranges that limp call when people are unbalanced, it's just going to turn a really nice profit.

72
00:11:11.456 --> 00:11:14.878
So back to the decision at hand.

73
00:11:15.658 --> 00:11:17.687
What sizing do you like here and why?

74
00:11:18.787 --> 00:11:26.548
When I'm playing a $150 tournament, there's two things that I ask myself straight away: Who is the opponent, and what does my hand want to do?

75
00:11:31.787 --> 00:11:33.277
Who is your opponent, what does my hand want to do?

76
00:11:33.728 --> 00:11:36.798
AA wants to get lots of money in pre-flop.

77
00:11:36.798 --> 00:11:37.798
So what's the best way to do that?

78
00:11:38.206 --> 00:11:43.746
In general, if I'm limping AA, it's versus someone that is going to do the Chrissy B thing, right?

79
00:11:44.246 --> 00:11:48.336
That's going to raise 85o 100% frequency.

80
00:11:49.197 --> 00:12:04.537
That way, they're going to put 3.5 BB in, and then we want to check-raise to a really big sizing because we want to now get A5o is going to fold whatever, but we want to get the maximum versus JTs or whatever.

81
00:12:05.357 --> 00:12:11.336
Versus a range that wants to see a flop, you want to charge that range a lot of money because it's not going to fold to a bet.

82
00:12:11.918 --> 00:12:14.777
He's never going to fold to a bluff here. He's just going to see a flop.

83
00:12:16.146 --> 00:12:19.788
So in those instances, it's very good to go big with value.

84
00:12:20.307 --> 00:12:24.788
When your range is polarized, the other person is incentivized to call.

85
00:12:26.158 --> 00:12:33.567
When your polarity increases, your sizing generally wants to increase with it because you're not interested in seeing a flop if that makes sense.

86
00:12:33.567 --> 00:12:34.228
So really nice.

87
00:12:36.418 --> 00:12:42.277
The absolute smallest I think we should go here is like 13x to 14x. I could definitely see the logic for going larger.

88
00:12:43.768 --> 00:12:45.396
I think I went 15x.

89
00:12:45.747 --> 00:12:46.857
I gave the AA discount.

90
00:12:47.366 --> 00:12:48.866
You've got to give them a little bit of rope.

91
00:12:49.497 --> 00:12:53.077
That's why I thought about 13x or 14x because you have that AA discount.

92
00:12:54.896 --> 00:12:57.658
13.9x or something, 13.99x.

93
00:12:59.347 --> 00:13:00.677
Yeah, I'm in for it.

94
00:13:01.817 --> 00:13:02.586
Let's see what I do.

95
00:13:02.586 --> 00:13:04.288
Okay, I'll go pretty big. I'll go bigger.

96
00:13:07.038 --> 00:13:10.518
But yeah, just always asking myself, who is the villain and what does my hand want to do?

97
00:13:11.907 --> 00:13:18.116
So if it's a passive guy, I would just raise 7x there because he's not going to 3-bet me.

98
00:13:19.497 --> 00:13:21.577
And he's going to call JTs whatever I do.

99
00:13:23.008 --> 00:13:26.798
So just target the inelastic continues, kind of.

100
00:13:28.187 --> 00:13:39.067
If you go 3.5x with AA, that's kind of the only money that's going in there unless he has JTs, Qs. They 3-bet if you go 7x anyway, so you're just guaranteeing money gets in there.

101
00:13:39.736 --> 00:13:40.366
Yeah, definitely.

102
00:13:41.158 --> 00:13:49.038
Now let's talk about Table 3. We're UTG. Jams 8-handed for 7 BB. We have A10s.

103
00:13:50.317 --> 00:13:52.288
What's your thought process here?

104
00:13:54.607 --> 00:13:58.218
Who is villain, and what does my hand want to do?

105
00:13:58.607 --> 00:14:00.677
I think I just want to fold here.

106
00:14:01.817 --> 00:14:07.388
This range shouldn't have many hands that we dominate in it.

107
00:14:08.777 --> 00:14:13.687
As in A9o can raise-fold, that's the only one. And there's five stacks behind.

108
00:14:14.626 --> 00:14:19.048
A9o could raise-fold, but will it raise-fold or will it just shove?

109
00:14:20.408 --> 00:14:23.237
AX, AK, AQ always shove anyway, they've got no.

110
00:14:25.597 --> 00:14:37.898
I would say that there's a certain percentage of the population who just jams way too many of their weak AX combos here and is just jamming too wide for 7 BB.

111
00:14:39.817 --> 00:14:42.857
So, "who is my opponent" is naturally a very good first question.

112
00:14:44.247 --> 00:14:46.048
But I think this one's extremely close.

113
00:14:48.337 --> 00:14:54.087
One thing, if it's close, like let's say I have 30 BB here, and I can cool fold to everyone behind.

114
00:14:55.228 --> 00:14:59.626
Or it's not that big of a 1/3 of my stack's quite a big hit to take.

115
00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:07.129
So 9 off the money, I think better to just if I'm not sure, just put 0 in.

116
00:15:08.299 --> 00:15:13.559
Because 9 off the money, see, that's an incredibly important factor.

117
00:15:14.369 --> 00:15:18.960
I'm not worried about ICM PV, mate. I'll take it PV.

118
00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:26.169
You did tell us. Well, you're 18 off the money. So, there's 79 left, 44th, 61 pay.

119
00:15:26.538 --> 00:15:34.200
It does make it significantly closer when there's this much ICM. Players are going to shove tighter. Our chips and our stack are much more valuable than they are otherwise.

120
00:15:35.788 --> 00:15:40.100
Yeah, I mean, the stage of the tournament is incredibly relevant here.

121
00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:43.340
So what if you're in the first 40% of a tournament?

122
00:15:46.059 --> 00:15:48.059
Oh, we get we get gambling shoes on.

123
00:15:49.629 --> 00:15:51.269
Are you just rejaming most likely?

124
00:15:53.639 --> 00:16:03.408
Your range is strong enough here where you probably don't want to have that many call folds. You're not looking to VPIP tons of hands here.

125
00:16:04.568 --> 00:16:09.090
So you have enough traps in your calling range that you're comfortable calling with obviously behind.

126
00:16:09.908 --> 00:16:16.889
I mean, maybe if we flat here, maybe AQ hero folds. I don't know. Maybe something like that happens, but.

127
00:16:17.389 --> 00:16:19.340
Yeah. I think call is better as well.

128
00:16:19.889 --> 00:16:26.960
But like, it is worth noting that if someone jams the CO and you have ATo on the BTN, it's going to be a re-jam scenario.

129
00:16:27.688 --> 00:16:33.430
For sure. And but then you don't have five guys behind that can wake up with TT or JJ.

130
00:16:33.719 --> 00:16:34.259
Exactly.

131
00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:40.950
But yeah, just a close spot, I'll just keep my 20 BBs and operate. I'd prefer to do that.

132
00:16:47.158 --> 00:16:48.328
Assuming you fold.

133
00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:53.598
Are you going to fold? You can just tell us and we can go to other hand here.

134
00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:57.139
I thought I'd keep the suspense. No, I just folded here.

135
00:16:59.408 --> 00:17:02.099
So I'm going to go back to this Q5♥️ hand.

136
00:17:06.959 --> 00:17:09.430
MP opens, SB calls, we over call Q5s.

137
00:17:10.219 --> 00:17:14.680
And it comes nothing for us. The turn is an A♥️ after it checks through.

138
00:17:16.589 --> 00:17:22.089
What are your thoughts on leading versus checking? I think a lot of people will just think, oh, I have a flush draw, I have to lead.

139
00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:37.490
I don't see much fold equity. The way Q5 makes its EV is once in position checks back and says I don't have QJ or KJ, I have 66.

140
00:17:38.449 --> 00:17:41.650
At the moment I'm attacking two ranges that still have JX.

141
00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:48.509
If I check the turn, I can hit my flush, or I can bluff with more info.

142
00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:55.769
As in now the SB checks three times and the in-position player checks twice. I think just delaying this hand to the river makes a lot of sense.

143
00:17:57.650 --> 00:17:59.779
We don't have that much fold equity on the turn.

144
00:18:00.348 --> 00:18:11.750
Yeah, and I do think it's a spot where people make the mistake of just leading turn because they have equity. And I agree with you completely. I don't think you really are going to get folds often enough to make it good.

145
00:18:12.788 --> 00:18:22.460
It comes back to that theme: what does my hand want to do? And Q5 wants to see a river for really good bluffing spots and it wants to realize.

146
00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:25.210
I've called the river here. Um.

147
00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:27.420
You did call the river here.

148
00:18:28.449 --> 00:18:31.779
I okay, I didn't see him value bet 88.

149
00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:40.348
No, for sure. And I thought a J would bet the turn really often. So sometimes we lose to J9s, J8s, JTs.

150
00:18:41.049 --> 00:18:44.889
But there's some K high, there's some 98s, 87s.

151
00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:47.378
There's enough bluffs in there, I think.

152
00:18:47.779 --> 00:18:51.360
Yeah. I was actually really surprised to see his exact hand.

153
00:18:53.639 --> 00:18:58.000
If he value bet 99, well played, I wouldn't expect it. People are just a bit nit.

154
00:18:58.740 --> 00:18:59.979
He showed you a full house for him.

155
00:19:02.389 --> 00:19:04.139
Yeah, good read. Dead read.

156
00:19:06.269 --> 00:19:09.378
But we saved the whole stack, mate. We saved 4 BBs.

157
00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:21.898
Do you think people have the mental aspect of, well, my hand could have bet the turn, so it's okay if I lose a bet anyway?

158
00:19:23.269 --> 00:19:30.639
No, I think people have the mental aspect of they need to win the pot rather than they need to make the maximum EV decision.

159
00:19:31.949 --> 00:19:48.389
As in you checking the turn there will make more money for Q5♥️, but you'll lose the pot more often. It's a very strange paradox. I'm not sure paradox is the right word, but it's like you're trying to maximize EV of your hand. You're not trying to win that pot.

160
00:19:50.078 --> 00:19:51.049
You're trying to make the highest EV.

161
00:19:51.389 --> 00:19:59.720
Yeah, I agree, but I'm saying people's mental hurdles, where they justify it as, 'Well, I would have lost this amount anyway, had I bet the turn.'

162
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.349
I can just call it.

163
00:20:03.490 --> 00:20:06.490
There is some logic to it. There's definitely logic to it.

164
00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:10.150
Yeah, I've kind of thought that way before.

165
00:20:10.150 --> 00:20:14.069
And I can definitely see people making that mistake where,

166
00:20:14.069 --> 00:20:26.538
let's just say 66 were to check back and then one of the players leads the river and they're like, well, I would have lost if I c-bet anyway, so I can call 66.

167
00:20:27.788 --> 00:20:36.559
Well, with 66, what you're doing is you're putting the right amount of money in the pot for your hand. So it can't be that bad, right?

168
00:20:37.358 --> 00:20:41.858
If you were meant to lose this bet, it can't be too bad, I think.

169
00:20:42.269 --> 00:20:47.490
But that's the mental issue that I'm talking about is, 'Well, it can't be that bad because I would have lost this much anyway.'

170
00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:54.670
But in reality, each individual decision is a different decision. The variables have changed. It's a different spot.

171
00:20:54.670 --> 00:21:01.809
We mentally trick ourselves into making mistakes, I think, when we do that.

172
00:21:02.578 --> 00:21:03.950
Sure, I can see that.

173
00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:07.189
So you defend J6o here versus UTG open.

174
00:21:08.279 --> 00:21:08.828
Yeah, yeah.

175
00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:15.650
And I think a lot of people are just going to fold this preflop, the vast majority probably.

176
00:21:16.489 --> 00:21:22.059
Well, all charts are 2.2x, 2.3x at 36. None of them are min-raise.

177
00:21:23.509 --> 00:21:29.619
And then also there's something happening with the 6 where most of his range is A-high, right?

178
00:21:30.339 --> 00:21:30.950
Yeah.

179
00:21:31.519 --> 00:21:39.689
What you get with the 66 is you always get like, you see a hand like K6s flatting four-bets, things like that, just because of the 2345 effect.

180
00:21:41.598 --> 00:21:46.729
So I think I would fold J5 and call J6, but it's very, very marginal. It's not like a big deal.

181
00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:52.920
Yeah. But when I'm playing six tables, I'm going to take any small edge if I'm playing six tables.

182
00:21:53.469 --> 00:21:55.700
If I'm playing 10 tables, I'll fold this preflop.

183
00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:59.578
For anyone who's watched your videos before, Pat does not like to fold preflop.

184
00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:02.000
No, mate. We're not fold it.

185
00:22:03.539 --> 00:22:06.589
That's an easy spot to miss with K8o by the way.

186
00:22:06.589 --> 00:22:09.110
That's like pure call for 4 BBs.

187
00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:11.229
I don't know about that, bro.

188
00:22:12.719 --> 00:22:15.348
I've looked at this quite a lot recently, it's a pure call.

189
00:22:16.199 --> 00:22:19.460
Why do you think this is a pure call? I would always fold this.

190
00:22:22.378 --> 00:22:25.559
Run it, probably run it, mate. Probably have a look in HRC.

191
00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:32.779
I was always folding this before too, but when you have money in the SB and then you're getting 3-to-1, sometimes the original raiser shoves and it gets heads-up too.

192
00:22:34.019 --> 00:22:38.250
Sometimes the original raiser shoves and it gets heads up too.

193
00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:44.199
Yeah, these are Also, when I've got 4 BBs here, I'm looking for any reason to gamble. I don't even have access to any part of the prize pool yet.

194
00:22:44.199 --> 00:22:47.449
I don't even have access to any part of the prize pool yet.

195
00:22:48.328 --> 00:22:55.229
I'm not going to min cash and I don't cover anyone, so I'm just playing you want to gamble as much as possible when you're very short in PSKO.

196
00:22:56.089 --> 00:23:04.990
So, yeah, keep in mind everyone, this is mostly, well, not mostly, but your decision would change if registration wasn't open still.

197
00:23:06.659 --> 00:23:11.960
And I'm not going to lie, in a $55, I'm a bit more incentivized to gamble than I am.

198
00:23:12.628 --> 00:23:13.969
If I was playing 10K.

199
00:23:14.389 --> 00:23:14.969
There we go.

200
00:23:15.579 --> 00:23:17.969
But the truth comes out.

201
00:23:18.568 --> 00:23:22.578
It's still a spot you're supposed to call way wider than people do.

202
00:23:24.309 --> 00:23:32.479
And yeah, you're looking for any excuse to gamble at 4 or 5 BBs when the whole table covers you. You're making no money in the tournament.

203
00:23:34.799 --> 00:23:36.699
So, on table 4, you raised KTo,

204
00:23:36.699 --> 00:23:40.889
and the BB, Jao, very good reg.

205
00:23:41.598 --> 00:23:43.759
I would say on the tighter side. What's your read there?

206
00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:45.389
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

207
00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:47.529
Defense big.

208
00:23:49.259 --> 00:23:51.519
More solid side of things, more solid.

209
00:23:52.538 --> 00:23:55.150
But a very good player at this stack depth.

210
00:23:55.759 --> 00:23:58.328
Are you just balancing your wide range wide c-bet?

211
00:23:59.809 --> 00:24:05.469
Yeah, it's actually only I think there's mostly just small bets happening here.

212
00:24:08.199 --> 00:24:14.068
It's a flush draw board, there's a lot of good run outs for him around the 4 and the 6.

213
00:24:14.650 --> 00:24:20.670
And also he has a nut advantage this deep. As in, he has K6o, K4o, 64o, we don't.

214
00:24:21.139 --> 00:24:23.709
So there's not actually that much big betting happening. But that's like a technical thing.

215
00:24:25.539 --> 00:24:29.470
If I think the guy's going to check-raise me a lot when I bet a quarter pot.

216
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.539
Again, it's like who is your opponent?

217
00:24:32.119 --> 00:24:35.250
If it's someone that's not check-raising, I'm going to bet half pot on flop, whatever.

218
00:24:35.628 --> 00:24:37.360
Who is your opponent? What does my hand want to do?

219
00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:39.459
KTo wants to get a little bit of action.

220
00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:42.840
Yeah, we have kicker problems.

221
00:24:44.378 --> 00:24:44.909
Yeah, yeah.

222
00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:47.740
Are you folding AK?

223
00:24:48.328 --> 00:24:49.809
Video must be frozen.

224
00:24:52.269 --> 00:24:54.599
We don't fold AK to one bet, mate.

225
00:24:55.299 --> 00:24:57.170
Oh, hold up, you added two more tables.

226
00:24:59.078 --> 00:24:59.389
Okay.

227
00:25:00.671 --> 00:25:03.550
Yeah, it should go back to normal in a second.

228
00:25:03.951 --> 00:25:04.421
Okay.

229
00:25:04.931 --> 00:25:09.680
I can adjust the thing now, hold on a sec.

230
00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:15.930
So what size did he, we didn't see the size you check-raised on the flop with, but I imagine it's like 4-5x.

231
00:25:16.890 --> 00:25:24.029
It's pretty easy to figure it out. You bet 1.4 into 5.6, and now there's about 15.6, so he made it 5 BBs.

232
00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:25.861
Made it 5 BBs.

233
00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:31.570
So, again, this really comes down to player type.

234
00:25:31.570 --> 00:25:38.161
When you bet 25% on the flop, most high stakes regs

235
00:25:39.529 --> 00:25:42.750
are going to do a lot of check-raising with 6x and 4x.

236
00:25:44.381 --> 00:25:46.520
In a solver, those hands are always randomizing.

237
00:25:47.451 --> 00:25:51.680
It's very easy to not randomize 65 and just check-raise it versus 25%.

238
00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:58.300
So it's definitely an over-bluffed node on the flop, I would say as Nazar.

239
00:25:59.201 --> 00:26:03.490
And then what do you think about the turn? Would you bet or check?

240
00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:10.740
I think he is actually going to have a lot of flush draws as well facing the smaller sizing.

241
00:26:11.661 --> 00:26:15.650
He's also going to have 58, 78.

242
00:26:16.150 --> 00:26:21.361
But those gut-shots, you know, they only have 6.6%, so it's not as big of a concern.

243
00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:27.750
I think if you go too much smaller, you might just get check-raised again and get put in a really difficult spot.

244
00:26:28.941 --> 00:26:35.340
I mean, I wouldn't mind. I'd be okay. I think it's so unnatural for him to check value on the turn here.

245
00:26:37.539 --> 00:26:44.200
This is where you can actually make quite a lot of money waving a red flag in front.

246
00:26:45.381 --> 00:26:51.490
As in, it's really tough for him to check, to check-raise the flop with a 6 and then go for a double check-raise on the turn.

247
00:26:53.789 --> 00:26:58.740
You don't mind inducing here. It's not that tough of a spot, I don't think. You actually make quite a lot of money.

248
00:26:59.210 --> 00:27:01.830
Because it's going to be really easy for him to overbluff.

249
00:27:02.849 --> 00:27:05.349
As in, he's kind of repping exactly 44.

250
00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:13.381
Then if you trigger something, he's more likely to just have a random 4x♣️ or a random 75 than he is 44.

251
00:27:18.670 --> 00:27:19.569
Yeah, I agree with that.

252
00:27:26.329 --> 00:27:27.240
So he folds.

253
00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:27.871
Stan is there.

254
00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:36.000
I'm also going to go back to the AK, 42 effective. Let me get off this four-wide screen. There we go.

255
00:27:37.889 --> 00:27:47.881
You'll notice, I think the vast majority of people are just all-in for 40 BBs here with AK, and for most people, I think that's probably the best play.

256
00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:55.770
However, when you do have such an aggressive 4-betting and a bluffing image, you get to click hands like this.

257
00:27:56.549 --> 00:28:03.950
Yeah. This is also a really good friend. This is a GTO trainer I've been coaching for the last three years or so.

258
00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:07.030
So he knows all about.

259
00:28:07.411 --> 00:28:15.539
He knows, he knows like there's definitely a non-zero percent chance he just takes A4s and he's just over-it versus me here.

260
00:28:16.849 --> 00:28:21.840
Also, what it does do, those very small times it goes all-in, all-in.

261
00:28:22.681 --> 00:28:23.860
You can probably get away then.

262
00:28:26.539 --> 00:28:36.721
As in if the UTG guy shoves and now Pat shoves with a cold 4-bet range behind, this is AA and KK only, kind of.

263
00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:38.250
So you can get away.

264
00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:41.441
Yeah, I hadn't thought about that. That's interesting.

265
00:28:41.441 --> 00:28:46.539
Shove call, lose less, induce. So a multi-faceted benefits here.

266
00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:51.810
And if he has AJo or A5s.

267
00:28:52.121 --> 00:28:56.401
I don't, there's only a 1 SPR. I'm fine with those hands calling.

268
00:28:57.651 --> 00:29:02.819
If he starts having 78s, now it starts becoming a bit dicey, now I'm more likely to shove.

269
00:29:03.621 --> 00:29:11.000
But as the range gets more linear, you shove AK, and then as the range gets more polar you're facing, then you start clicking it.

270
00:29:14.651 --> 00:29:19.000
As in if he's having AQ here and he's calling my shove, I'm always shoving AK.

271
00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:23.360
When he's not calling AQ and he's polar, then you need to give him a bit more.

272
00:29:23.951 --> 00:29:25.211
Give him a little bit more rope.

273
00:29:26.170 --> 00:29:26.789
Yeah, for sure.

274
00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:31.461
All right, well let's end this part here and we will see everyone in the next one.

275
01:11:52.000 --> 01:12:12.000
I think the turn is somewhat mandatory because of what you mentioned: the T-x and the Js no heart.

276
01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:42.000
But then the question comes down to, do we follow through or not? So I agree with you, I think the turn is probably maybe not a slam dunk, but a bet we should be taking.

277
01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:52.000
Looks like you're going third and not

278
01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:42.000
Cool. I went 8.5. Okay, I went 8.5.

279
01:37:52.000 --> 01:38:12.000
So 8.5 is going to be a mandatory call versus most players.

280
01:38:52.000 --> 01:39:21.997
Yeah, yeah, so I wanted to get the early history, I forgot.

281
01:40:02.000 --> 01:44:51.997
You re-ran the hand.

282
01:44:52.000 --> 01:45:12.000
It doesn't just me checking to see who he is and the note I have on him, it might not change my pre-flop decision with AQ, but it sets my mindset for the whole hand, right?

283
01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:51.997
Yeah.

284
02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:42.000
Mhm.

285
02:04:52.000 --> 02:05:12.000
And he also went third instead of quarter, which makes sense based on the smaller pre-flop raise. But again, I don't really think that it changes our decision tree. You know, like we still have a hand that wants to call flop. We still have a hand that wants to bet turn.

286
02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:52.000
It's just information for later in the hand. That's it, it doesn't change his decision immediately.

287
02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:22.000
Um.

288
02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:55.000
But yeah, I think it's kind of a 'whatever' spot, I think, on the river. Definitely

289
02:40:52.000 --> 02:41:12.000
I wouldn't like betting turn then giving up river. So it's either one or the two, right? You either bet the turn and follow through or you check the turn and then delay bluff the river.

290
02:53:12.000 --> 02:53:15.000
Oh, you don't like shutting down.

291
02:54:22.000 --> 02:54:42.000
Well, I never shut down. I always think once this guy checks twice, you probably get some really good bluffing opportunities.

292
03:11:12.000 --> 03:11:32.000
So I'm almost never giving up in hands. I'm waiting until later to bluff, is the way I look at it.

293
03:12:52.000 --> 03:14:11.997
Yeah. As in the more the more range checks, the more likely it is to fold.

294
03:14:12.000 --> 03:14:32.000
So you come with third.

295
03:15:22.000 --> 03:16:11.997
Okay.

296
03:22:52.000 --> 03:23:12.000
As in like when he bets the flop and then checks twice, 99 is always in that range.

297
03:26:42.000 --> 03:27:02.000
Now when we bet the turn, that range still has AA and AK. You know what I mean? You strip the strong hands when he double checks.

298
03:38:12.000 --> 03:38:32.000
And it's also so important to point out that you mentioned 99. A lot of the players watching this video, 99 are not in this range. Neither is ATs. Neither is AJ. Neither are all of these different pieces, right? So a very strong argument can be made for folding against players who are massively under 3-betting.

299
03:56:32.000 --> 03:56:52.000
100%.

300
04:03:22.000 --> 04:03:25.000
Which is a lot of population.

301
04:13:42.000 --> 04:14:02.000
And just speed of 3-bet too, I think, just when you're playing six tables, I really watch timing.

302
04:19:22.000 --> 04:19:42.000
As in like if he has A5s, you're going to think, 'Do I flat or do I 3-bet?' If you have AK, you just 3-bet. The timing's quite important.

303
04:22:22.000 --> 04:22:25.000
Yeah. When you're playing versus humans.

304
04:29:52.000 --> 04:30:12.000
I mean, we ran into AK, which I don't think says much about my bluff, really?

305
04:37:52.000 --> 04:38:12.000
No. It only says if he calls like ATo♠️, that says a lot about my bluff, I guess.

306
04:41:52.000 --> 04:42:12.000
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

307
04:54:22.000 --> 04:54:25.000
So you open AA 100 BB deep on table one, top left guy.

308
04:59:22.000 --> 04:59:42.000
And you know, we have a Talk a little bit about the theory behind limping at this stack depth versus raising. From a GTO perspective, it wants to have a lot more limps at the 100 BB deep stack depth, just because of
